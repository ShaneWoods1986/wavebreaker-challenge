You should develop the web application in this coding challenge using React.
This application will use Pixabay API (http://www.pixabay.com) to fetch images. These
will have to be rendered on the page. The UI of this page should consist of a grid layout
(for example like Pixabay itself or Unsplash). You can decide the pagination system for
the content of the page (page numbers, infinite scroll, etc).

A second page for detail view should be implemented. This page should include a
bigger version of the selected image, the name of the photographer, tags, views,
downloads and size. You can decide the look and feel of the page.



## Key
Pixabay API documentation: https://pixabay.com/api/docs/
Pixabay Key: 6473511-0417f2cad683f1bee54cafe15

The provided key will let you make 5000 API calls per hour. If you like or you run out of
requests, feel free to create another Pixabay account and use that access key instead.
The app should be tested (unit tests) and the code should contain comments where
appropriate. You can use any library/framework you like.

The content should be visible correctly both in desktop and smartphones for both list
and detail view pages.

## Delivery

For the delivery of the code, we suggest the creation of a repository in a platform chosen
by you (github, bitbucket, gitlab, etc.). Repository should be publicly accessible so we
can get the code.
It would be convenient to do periodic commits while you close features so we can see
the progress of the code. You should include a brief README file where you explain
how to run the project, or special things to consider.
When you complete, please send an email to ahmet.cetin@wavebreakmedia.com with
the link to the repository.
